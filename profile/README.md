# Welcome to the Circadiaware Collective!

We are a group of researchers, software engineers, citizen scientists and patients advocates working together to conceive novel tools for the study, management and treatment of circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders such as non-24 or DSPD, which are severely disabling and debilitating.

In the spirit of open science and transparency, all tools are published under an open-source license and will be free forever!

We welcome everybody to join our collective by contributing to an existing project or by submitting a new open-source resource related to the management or treatment of circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders. If you are interested and you think you can contribute in any way, please join us to shape the future of circadian rhythm sleep science!

The goal of the collective is to deduplicate efforts, bring together people who share common goals (such as developing similar apps), to raise awareness about these poorly known disorders, and to provide a centralized resource on the internet to publicize the tools produced by the community.

If you don't know where to start or if you are a user interested in testing some of our tools, have a look at our list of projects: https://github.com/Circadiaware/crd-projects or at our most popular projects pinned just below.
