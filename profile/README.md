# Welcome to the Circadiaware Collective!

We are a group of researchers, software engineers, citizen scientists and patients advocates working together to conceive novel tools for the study, management and treatment of circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders such as non-24 or DSPD, which are severely disabling and debilitating.

All tools are published under an open-source license, and anybody can join the collective by contributing to an existing project of the collective or by submitting a new open-source resource related to the management or treatment of circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders.

The goal of the collective is to deduplicate efforts, bring together people who share common goals (such as developing similar apps), and provide a centralized resource on the internet to publicize the tools produced by the community.

If you don't know where to start, have a look at our list of projects: https://github.com/Circadiaware/crd-projects
