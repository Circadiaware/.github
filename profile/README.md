# Welcome to the Circadiaware collective!

We are a group of researchers, software engineers, citizen scientists and patient advocates, working together to conceive novel tools for the study, management and treatment of circadian-rhythm sleep-wake disorders such as [non-24](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-24-hour_sleep%E2%80%93wake_disorder) or [DSPD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delayed_sleep_phase_disorder), which are severely disabling and debilitating.

In the spirit of open science and transparency, all tools are published under an open-source license and will be free forever!

We welcome everybody to join our collective by contributing to an existing project or by submitting a new open-source resource related to the management or treatment of circadian-rhythm sleep-wake disorders. If you are interested and you think you can contribute in any way, please join us to shape the future of circadian-rhythm sleep science!

The goal of the collective is to deduplicate efforts, bring together people who share common goals (such as developing similar apps), to raise awareness about these poorly known disorders, and to provide a centralized resource on the internet to publicize the tools produced by the community.

If you don't know where to start, or if you're interested in testing some of our tools, have a look at:
* [Web Actogram](https://github.com/Circadiaware/webactogram) &mdash; A novel, instantaneous mass screening tool for sleep patterns&mdash;and maybe disorders&mdash;by using the web browser's history.
* [VLiDACMel](https://circadiaware.github.io/VLiDACMel-entrainment-therapy-non24/SleepNon24VLiDACMel.html) &mdash; An unvalidated, experimental protocol to manage the non-24 and DSPD circadian-rhythm disorders&mdash;mainly using very long light therapy. (Also includes a review of circadian-rhythm sleep science.)
* [Wearadian](https://circadiaware.github.io/wearadian/docs/Wearadian.html) &mdash; Designs for experiments to 24/7-in-situ-monitor circadian-rhythm sleep disorder biomarkers. Used to collect the data of the [MyNon24Sleep](https://figshare.com/projects/MyNon24_-_A_self-study_of_the_circadian_rhythm_and_its_altering_factors/101804) dataset.
