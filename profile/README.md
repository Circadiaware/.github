# Welcome to the Circadiaware Collective!

We are a group of researchers, software engineers, citizen scientists and patients advocates working together to bring novel tools for the treatment and management of circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders such as non-24 or DSPD, which are severely disabling and debilitating.

All tools are published under an open-source license, and anybody can join the collective by submitting an open-source resource related to the management or treatment of circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders.

The goal of the collective is to deduplicate efforts, bring together people who share common goals (such as developing similar apps), and provide a centralized resource on the internet to publicize the tools produced by the community.
